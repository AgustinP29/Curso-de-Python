Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
is not simply random text. It has roots 
in a piece tof classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one tof the more obscure 
Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites tof the word in classical literature, 
discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 tof "de Finibus Bonorum et 
Malorum" (The Extremes tof Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory tof ethics, 
very popular during the Renaissance. The first line tof Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line 
in section 1.10.32.
